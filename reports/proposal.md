## Saturday Night Live: FTP Server Client
#### By Shruti Iyer, Nora Mohamed, and Lucy Wilcox
 
### Overview and Goals
We plan on creating a system where files can be shared between a server and clients. Our first goal is to create a TCP server. Next we will add an FTP layer to enable us to transfer files. Our stretch goals include creating HTTP server/client communication, improving usability of our upload download system, and adding functionality for searching for files on the server. 

As part of this project we want to learn about different layers of the network and understand how they are implemented. Generally we are more interested in expanding our knowledge about network protocols and how they work rather than creating a user friendly system. This might also mean that we do a substantial amount of reading on the topic of networking. We also want to continue to improve our C language skills and understand the C libraries used in networking. We also want to learn more about writing production level code in C.

### Resources and Inspiration
We were inspired to research and work on this project because of a previous SoftSys project where the team built an [HTTP Server in C](https://matthewruehle.github.io/SoftSysQuestingQuail/). 

We found a few resources to help us get started with socket programming using C libraries. "Beej's Guide to Network Programming" by Brian Hall contains resources to understand networking concepts and implementing them using C. 
[This](thttps://github.com/angrave/SystemProgramming/wiki/Networking,-Part-4:-Building-a-simple-TCP-Server) Github repo contains tutorials and examples for a TCP server. 

We will also use Chapter 11 of Head First C which talks about sockets and networking.

### First steps

Our first steps include learning about implementing a TCP server. To do this we will each read two sources on network programming, we will all read part “Beej’s Guide to Network Programing” to understand the topic. 

Next we will each read a different implementation of a TPC server in C. (Examples [1](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15213-f99/www/class26/tcpserver.c), [2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/socket-programming-cc/), [3](http://cs.ecs.baylor.edu/~donahoo/practical/CSockets/textcode.html), [4](https://www.binarytides.com/server-client-example-c-sockets-linux/), and [5](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSLTBW_2.1.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r1.hala001/server.htm))

After this we will create a roadmap of what steps we need to complete based on our research and assign tasks from this.
